## Task 1: Infiltrating the OSU! (I)
Question: Let's infiltrate OSU! Hint: Maybe you may want to visit the author's osu! homepage!

Flag: `osu{tr1v4l_5rc_1n5p3c7_1n_webs1t3}`

The question provided us a website that will most likely give us the flag and the author's osu! profile. The website wants us to find the banner image with its respective domain.

Looking at his banner picture, it seems similar to the website provided. Opening the image in a new tab, the URL can be obtained `https://assets.ppy.sh/user-profile-covers/13336293/e20fc9c84f8f20881bfa0bb70bbcb68c6b50bb25dc96cf608e431a7f9f482c25.jpeg`
